# FitCore Gym Landing Page

## Description
This project is a **Landing Page** for FitCore Gym, designed to showcase the gym's services, trainers, and facilities.  
The layout is implemented using **CSS `float` and `inline-block`**, without using Flexbox or Grid, as it was a specific task requirement.

The page includes:
- Hero section with title, description, and call-to-action buttons
- Multiple cards for services, trainers, or testimonials
- Responsive design for larger screens
- Styled navigation and footer

## Features
- **Float-based layout:** Used to align sections and cards side by side.
- **Inline-block elements:** Used for aligning buttons and cards horizontally.
- **Custom styling:** Rounded cards, spacing, and hover effects applied.
- **Responsive design:** Works on desktop screens, especially at 1440px width or higher.
